# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Cluster seams on the placement contract (groundwork for multi-host
  clustering, #20): `ActorPlacement.bind?(local, silo)`
  returning `PlacementBindings` — activation claim/release hooks
  (`beforeActivate` / `afterDeactivate`), `strictChainPresence`, and a
  `shouldTickReminders` gate for reminder leader election. All optional;
  single-node behavior unchanged.
- New `ActorErrorKind`s `'wrong-host'` (`ActorWrongHostError`, carries an
  owner hint) and `'unreachable'` (`ActorUnreachableError`); both map to a
  retryable 503 if they ever reach the public wire. Exhaustive switches on
  `ActorErrorKind` gain two cases.
- `DeactivationReason` gains `'migrated'` — reserved for cluster
  rebalancing, not yet emitted.

### Changed

- Reminder-table mutations now reload-and-reapply on a storage etag
  conflict (up to 3 attempts) instead of failing — the table legitimately
  has concurrent writers once silos share storage.
- `mintCallId()` ids carry a per-process random component so ids from
  different hosts and restarts are distinguishable. The format remains
  opaque.

### Fixed

- External wire calls now inherit the silo's `callTimeoutMs` deadline, as
  documented. Previously only in-process external calls got a deadline;
  wire calls could hang past the configured timeout without a 504.

- Initial release of `@sigx/actors` — Orleans-style virtual actors for
  SignalX.
- `defineActor` with options-object + `methods`/`streams` factories; state
  as a deep `@sigx/reactivity` signal; explicit `ctx.save()` (default) or
  opt-in write-behind persistence.
- Single-node silo (`createSilo`): lazy activation directory, per-activation
  mailbox with turn-based concurrency, idle sweep, graceful deactivation and
  shutdown, `deactivateType` for dev/HMR.
- Call-chain reentrancy metadata with immediate `ActorDeadlockError` on
  cycles; `reentrant: true` for call-chain re-entry.
- `ActorStorage` seam with etag optimistic concurrency; `memoryStorage()`
  and `fileStorage({ dir })` providers; conflict = fault-and-reload
  (Orleans `InconsistentStateException` semantics).
- Volatile timers (mailbox-serialized, coalesced) and durable reminders
  (storage-backed, re-activate idle actors, 60s floor).
- Wire layer riding the serverFn endpoint: `handleActorRequest` /
  `matchesActorRequest` / `createActorResolver` (`./server`), generic typed
  client proxy + `configureActors` (`./client`), `createActorHandler` +
  `attachSignalHandlers` (`./node`). NDJSON streams end-to-end.
- Transport-independent guard chains (`use` / `methodUse`) shared by wire
  and in-process calls; `requireGuards` build gate (default on).
- `sigxActors()` Vite plugin: `*.actor.ts` client-module swap, prod registry
  (`virtual:sigx-actors`), dev silo through the SSR module runner, HMR
  deactivate-through-storage.
